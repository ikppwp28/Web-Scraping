# Web-Scraping
Web scraping in this work uses two libraries, namely Selenium and Beautiful Soup. Selenium is a Python library used to automate web browsers, while Beautiful Soup is a Python library used to extract and navigate HTML and XML structures from web pages, both of which are used together to perform web scraping efficiently and flexibly.
